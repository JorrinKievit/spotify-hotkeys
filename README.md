# Spotify-hotkeys

This is a desktop application to add the currently playing song to a playlist. It uses global shortcuts, which means it can be used even when the window is not in focus!

## Get started
Run the SpotifyHotkeys-Setup exe found in Releases. It will show a prompt by Windows SmartScreen. Click on Run Anyway

First the application will prompt you to Login with Spotify. Using the account the application retrieves the current playing song, and supplies the ability to add the song to the playlist.

After that, Click on "Open in app". The retrieved token will be supplied to the application. This process only needs to happen once per device.

Now you are able to set the hotkey using the Cog wheel, and choose the preffered playlist. As seen in the examples below.
